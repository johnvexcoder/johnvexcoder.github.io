# Observe Brand Visibility

**Research:** [Open the numbered claim and source ledger](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#citation-and-traceability-registry). [P05](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#p05)

Use AEO Preview when available so raw answers, prompt hashes, provider identity, and deterministic extraction remain reproducible. [C12](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c12) [P04](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#p04)

When AeoKit tools or an AeoKit runtime are available, read the bundled [AeoKit API workflow](api/aeokit.md) before using them; the skill must still work without AeoKit. [P05](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#p05)

## Workflow

Use the first compatible run series as the explicit baseline. Later observations must preserve the corpus and compatibility fields below so AeoKit can evaluate experiments without silently changing the measurement instrument. [C12](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c12) [C15](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c15)

1. Record the brand, canonical domain, aliases, category, audience, use case, competitors, business outcome, and the exact buyer prompts. Preserve each prompt's provenance; generated prompts are hypotheses, not proof of customer demand. [C12](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c12) [P01](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#p01)
2. Lint prompts for neutrality. Avoid prompts that presume the tracked brand is best, deserving of inclusion, or the desired answer. Start each independent prompt in a fresh conversation; version a multi-turn journey as a different corpus and retain its full transcript. [C12](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c12) [C15](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c15)
3. Choose and label the evidence source: native owner telemetry, verified referrals, public consumer-surface observation, or controlled simulation. Never blend these into one visibility score. [C11](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c11)
4. Keep provider, product surface, displayed model when available, search/grounding mode, account state, locale, geography, device, timestamp, samples, corpus order, prompt hash, and parser version in every run record. [C12](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c12)
5. Start with one fixture or otherwise cost-free sample as an integration check. Before any live or subscription-backed run, obtain authorization for the provider, maximum samples, and cost ceiling. Inspect raw answers, citation destinations, and extraction errors before increasing usage. [C14](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c14) [P04](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#p04) [P06](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#p06)
6. Report raw numerators and denominators, mention rate, canonical-domain citation rate, supported-brand-claim rate when reviewed, observation and failure counts, uncertainty interval when appropriate, source domains and ownership, and competitor mentions. [C13](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c13) [C14](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c14) [C18](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c18)
7. Compare only compatible runs. Refuse or clearly qualify comparisons across changed prompt corpora, providers, product surfaces, access modes, account states, locales, or material model changes. [C01](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c01) [C12](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c12)
8. Preserve accepted negative answers, abstentions, and technical failures as distinct outcomes. Absence is data; a failed run is not a negative mention. [C12](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c12)
9. Prefer available native reports for their own surfaces, including Google Search Console generative AI impressions and Bing Webmaster Tools AI Performance. Do not reverse-engineer a native platform total from prompt samples. [C10](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c10) [C16](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c16)

Read [references/measurement-contract.md](references/measurement-contract.md) before defining metrics or interpreting a run. [C11](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c11) [P05](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#p05)

## Commands

When observing for an AeoKit experiment, attach resulting run IDs only after confirming they match its baseline corpus and surfaces. Move the experiment to `evaluating`; do not label it won or lost from one noisy observation. [C12](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c12) [C13](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c13)

For a configured project, resolve and record one approved `aeo-preview` version for the whole run series; do not use `@latest` for comparable baselines and reruns. [C12](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c12) [P06](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#p06)

```bash
AEO_PREVIEW_VERSION="X.Y.Z"
npx "aeo-preview@${AEO_PREVIEW_VERSION}" run --provider codex --samples 1
npx "aeo-preview@${AEO_PREVIEW_VERSION}" report --markdown
npx "aeo-preview@${AEO_PREVIEW_VERSION}" diff
```

Claude Code can be used with `--provider claude`. Use the fixture provider for CI and parser tests. Never replace fixture runs with live subscription calls in unattended CI. [P04](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#p04)

## Boundaries

Call subscription-backed agent or API results `directional agent simulations` unless the run genuinely observes a named public consumer surface. Do not infer causality from before/after changes, pool incompatible surfaces, trust a citation without checking its destination when support matters, or call a single observation a stable visibility score. [C01](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c01) [C11](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c11) [C13](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c13) [C15](https://github.com/aeokit-dev/aeokit-skills/blob/v0.1.1/research/report-source.md#c15)
